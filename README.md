## Environmental Data

This data was provided by Geoscience Australia and full metadata can be found in the main text and Huang et al (2010).

## Cyclone Data

This data was provided by Marji Puotinen and was simply subsampled at 0.01 degree resolution. See Puotinen et al (2016) for details of the Cyclone wave model.

## DHW data

This data was provided by NOAA as is.

## Bleaching Data

This data was interpolated via inverse distance weighting from aerial surveys. See BleachingInterpolation.R for details
